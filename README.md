Spinner experiment with Maxxon AMAX 32 motor

## Status

In development.

## Background

This is an updated version of the experiment we used in academic year 2021/22, which can be found [here](https://github.com/practable/spinner-nidec). The AMAX 32 motor we are using has less friction, so it has a more ideal second order response. We are currently developing this (See the develop branch if you want to know how far along we are).
